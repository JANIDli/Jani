I'm Janitha Dilshan Wanasinghe, an enthusiastic Information Technology undergraduate with a strong foundation in web development, quality assurance testing, and graphic design. Currently in my final year at ESoft Metro Campus, Colombo, Sri Lanka, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a focus on Software Engineering.

Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, PHP, and Laravel. I have hands-on experience as a Quality Assurance Tester at Global System Solution, where I collaborated with a dedicated team to perform comprehensive tests on image processing data. Additionally, I have worked as a freelance graphic designer on Fiverr, where I specialized in object removal, photo retouching, social media post design, and YouTube thumbnails.

I am passionate about creating innovative web solutions and continuously improving my technical skills. Some of my notable projects include a QR Code Restaurant Management System, a Personal Blogging Website, a Music Beat Downloading Website, and an NIC Validation Web App. These projects have allowed me to explore various aspects of web development and problem-solving.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong soft skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and effective communication. I am a proactive learner who enjoys taking on new challenges and contributing to dynamic and collaborative environments.

When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me creating music, singing, or playing cricket. I also run a YouTube channel, JS Explorer, where I share tech tips and tutorials with a growing audience from Sri Lanka and India.

I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge in a web development intern position, where I can contribute to exciting projects and further develop my expertise.</p>
